# mvcpp

A high performance web framework using C++ and MVC framework.

Every controller module in the web site is compiled to an so library and support hot updating
for the new controller modules.

Also I used some AST analysis technichs of clang when writing the contorller class, which make 
controller method can be defined in a clear syntex and very little coding.
